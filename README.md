## Project Summary
## Project Goal:
Predict student letter grades based on non-traditional factors such as age, sex, relationship status, and parental status, rather than solely focusing on academic performance.

Data: The project utilized a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository containing information about students, including both academic and non-academic attributes.

## Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Dropped academic-related features, encoded categorical variables, and explored data distribution.
Model Development: Built a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with a SimpleRNN layer, dropout, and dense layers.
Model Training: Trained the model using early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results: The model achieved an accuracy of 95% and demonstrated strong performance across different evaluation metrics.

# Conclusion: 
The project successfully demonstrated the potential of using non-traditional factors to predict student grades. Further research could explore the impact of different RNN architectures and hyperparameter tuning on model performance.
